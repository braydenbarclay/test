<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Brayden Barclay and I grew up in the city of Cambridge, Ontario. With a desired passion for cars and video games growing up, which strived me to pursue things digitally when I was older. I had never really touch art that much as a kid or even a teenager besides those very questionable drawings my parents hung on the fridge thinking it was perfect. I didn't fully get into art until like a year before college. Everyone I knew was rather Factory workers and/or Mechanics, as I took the approach to become a graphic designer, one of the only art based people in my family and friends. I have chosen to rock more with digital drawing and photo editing on Photoshop and love photography. but also love any other form of art including music and cinematography.</p>

<h1>Why Listen to Me?</h1>
<p>We all start somewhere! We are all artists. No matter what we do or specialize in, we are all artists. Don't limit yourself to just one thing, try other things and always push yourself to the limits with everything you do. in the end this is the most competetive job and it's constantly Graphic Designer versus Graphic Designer. as long as you keep pushing yourself from the beginning to the best of your ability, I can almost promise you that you'll succeed. Sometimes art can get hard and stressful and make you want to run away from art as a whole but NEVER give up. It's the key to this industry, to keep striving to learn new things and be better and to keep going.</p>
